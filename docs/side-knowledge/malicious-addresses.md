# Malicious Addresses

Ecosystem partners may choose to implement some warning to users about malicious tokens in the ecosystem.

The Scam token can be assigned to users or contracts that are malicious. They are non-transferable and non-burnable.

To request a token be added, please raise an issue on the Github issues board for the threat to be assessed.
