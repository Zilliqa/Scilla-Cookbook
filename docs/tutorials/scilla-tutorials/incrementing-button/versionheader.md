# Version headers

## Scilla version

Our previous contract had no defined Scilla version and therefore wouldn't be valid if we tried to compile it.

:::caution
If you tried to compile the contract in it's current state you would be returned the error ```Scilla version number unspecified```.
:::

To fix this, we declare the current Scilla version using the ```scilla_version``` keyword. The variable appended is the Scilla version we are implementing in our contract.
Currently we are using ```scilla_version 0```

```ocaml {1}
scilla_version 0

contract IncrementingButton
(
  contract_owner: ByStr20
)
```

## User defined libraries

Our previous contract had no user library defined and therefore wouldn't be valid if we tried to compile it.

:::caution
If you tried to compile the previous contract, you would be returned the error ```After specifying a Scilla version number, either imports, a library or contract is expected.```
:::

To fix this, we declare the current library we are defining using the ```library``` keyword. The variable appended is the library name we are implementing in our contract.

We will use our contract name for easier association, ```library MyFirstContract```.

In the library section, we will put global variables and functions which define our contract. We can refer to these from another contract.

:::note
A Scilla file with only a library definition is considered valid Scilla and is referred to as a .scillib
:::

```ocaml {3}
scilla_version 0

library IncrementingButton

contract IncrementingButton
(
  contract_owner: ByStr20
)
```

:::tip
```IncrementingButton``` now successfully compiles!
:::

## Builtin internal libraries

The Scilla standard library contains five libraries: ```BoolUtils.scilla```, ```IntUtils.scilla```, ```ListUtils.scilla```, ```NatUtils.scilla``` and ```PairUtils.scilla.``` As the names suggests these contracts implement utility operations for the Bool, Int, List, Nat and Pair types, respectively.

To use functions from the standard library in a contract, the relevant library file must be imported using the ```import``` keyword followed by the library to be imported. To import more than one library, separate each library with a whitespace character.

Scilla supports deploying both libraries and contract, and each library or contract can import already deployed libraries.

:::note
We will omit the internal libraries from this IncrementingButton as they are not required.

```ocaml {3}
scilla_version 0

import ListUtils IntUtils

library IncrementingButton

contract IncrementingButton
(
  contract_owner: ByStr20
)
```
