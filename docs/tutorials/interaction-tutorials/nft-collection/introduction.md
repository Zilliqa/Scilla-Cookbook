# Introduction

We are going to use Zilliqa-JS to interact with our deployed ZRC-6 NFT contract.

You don't need any previous experience with Zilliqa-JS to follow along with this tutorial, but experience with Javascript, Node.js and npm will be useful. Doing the [incrementing button](../incrementing-button-interaction/introduction.md) example is recommended first.

## NFT Collection interaction

NFT Collection interaction is a walkthrough tutorial of some of the typical actions you might perform using Zilliqa-JS SDK to interact with deployed contract. The objective for this tutorial is:

* Use Zilliqa-JS to deploy a ZRC-6 contract to the network
* Use Zilliqa-JS to BatchMint tokens to addresses using a minter address
* Use Zilliqa-JS to get the mutable state of our contract to determine if it's using token_uri or base_uri

## Setup of project

Similar to the [IncrementingButton](../incrementing-button-interaction/introduction.md) example, we will need the Zilliqa-JS dependency to interact easily with the blockchain.
