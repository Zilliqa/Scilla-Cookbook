# Introduction

We are going to use Zilliqa-JS to interact with our deployed "IncrementingButton" contract.

You don't need any previous experience with Zilliqa-JS to follow along with this tutorial, but experience with Javascript, Node.js and npm will be useful

## IncrementingButtonInteraction

IncrementingButtonInteraction is a walkthrough tutorial of the basic concepts of using Zilliqa-JS SDK to interact with deployed contracts with the following objectives.

* Use Zilliqa-JS to interact with and press the button
* Use Zilliqa-JS to get the mutable state of our contract
* Use Zilliqa-JS to listen for events in our contract.
