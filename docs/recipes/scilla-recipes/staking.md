# Staking

| Contract Name | File and Location | Description | Mainnet |
|--|--|--|--|
|SSNList| [`ssnlist.scilla`](https://github.com/Zilliqa/staking-contract/blob/main/contracts/ssnlist.scilla)| The main contract that keeps track of Staked Seed Nodes _aka_ SSNs, the delegators, the amount staked by a delegator with an SSN, and available rewards, etc.| [zil15lr86jwg937urdeayvtypvhy6pnp6d7p8n5z09](https://viewblock.io/zilliqa/address/zil15lr86jwg937urdeayvtypvhy6pnp6d7p8n5z09?txsType=subs) |
|SSNListProxy| [`proxy.scilla`](https://github.com/Zilliqa/staking-contract/blob/main/contracts/proxy.scilla)  | A proxy contract that sits on top of the SSNList contract. Any call to the `SSNList` contract must come from `SSNListProxy`. This contract facilitates upgradeability of the `SSNList` contract in case a bug is found.| [zil1v25at4s3eh9w34uqqhe3vdvfsvcwq6un3fupc2](https://viewblock.io/zilliqa/address/zil1v25at4s3eh9w34uqqhe3vdvfsvcwq6un3fupc2?tab=state) |
|Wallet| [`multisig_wallet.scilla`](https://github.com/Zilliqa/staking-contract/blob/main/contracts/multisig_wallet.scilla)  | A multisig wallet contract tailored to work with the `SSNListproxy` contract. Certain transitions in the `SSNListProxy` contract can only be invoked when k-out-of-n users have agreed to do so. This logic is handled using the `Wallet` contract. | [zil1ur8ehr9qeqrgkgf3qj3ruv5dyt0w8nj53drvuz](https://viewblock.io/zilliqa/address/zil1ur8ehr9qeqrgkgf3qj3ruv5dyt0w8nj53drvuz)|
