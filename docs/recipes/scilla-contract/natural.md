# Natural Numbers

NAT types are natural numbers. You can start at 0 using,

```Zero```

and have a way to get the next one, i.e. its successor using,

```Succ```

```Nat``` is used as a part of [folding](folding).

```ocaml
scilla_version 0
(***************************************************)
(* The built-in ADT "Nat"                          *)
(***************************************************)
import NatUtils

contract NatType()

field counter: Nat = Zero

(* emit the current value of the counter in an event *)
procedure EmitCounterAsNumber()
  c <- counter;
  number = nat_to_int c; (* from NatUtils *)
  ev = {_eventname : "EmitCounter"; counter_value: number};
  event ev
end

(* Increase the counter: get next Peano Number *)
transition Increase()
  c <- counter;
  next = Succ c;
  counter := next;
  EmitCounterAsNumber
end

(* Decrease the counter: get previous Peano Number    *)
(* floored at Zero, i.e. there is no previous to Zero *)
transition DecreaseFlooredAtZeo()
  c <- counter;
  previous_opt = nat_prev c; (* from NatUtils *)
  previous = let p =
    match previous_opt with
    | None => (* counter was Zero, remains at Zero *)
      Zero
    | Some x =>
      x
    end in (* previous_opt *)
  p;
  counter := previous;
  EmitCounterAsNumber
end
```
